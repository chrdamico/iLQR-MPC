Repository for a project of the course "Underactuated Robots" at La Sapienza University. This project was completed by Barbara Bazzana, Tommaso Belvedere and Christian D'Amico.

Aim of the project was developing an implementation of the paper Synthesis and Stabilization of Complex Behaviors through Online Trajectory Optimization (https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~todorov/papers/TassaIROS12.pdf) and testing it on a simulated Acrobot.

Final output of the project were a report (available here) and a powerpoint presentation.
